# PixiWorld

A mobile life simulator where you can build the city and manage the community of people! Effortlessly create the world of your dreams, as the only limit is your imagination! Escape the boundaries of the real world, and take rule of a new world accompanies by only you and your dreams!

***NOTE: This project is far from finished, so many planned features are not implemented. Expect some bugs while testing game changes, too. If any bugs arise, do immediately report to us through the ISSUES tab!***

## How to Build
1. Download the file as a `zip`
2. Unzip the file in an appropriate location (ideally back it up)
3. Download Unity, preferably Unity 6 *Preview*
4. In Unity Hub, open the downloaded file by using `add project from disk`
5. Open the file
6. Make changes as approved by the checklist.

## How to Merge
1. Download Git to push changes.
2. Save the changes that you made.
3. Back up your project (or duplicate it) so that it doesn't get corrupted. This project was nearly lost forever, and would have been gone if I hadn't backed it up. So treat this as a warning!
4. Open Git, then use `cd` to level up the directory to the location where it is saved.
5. Use `git init` to initilize the git
6. Use `git add .` to upload the new git files
7. Use `git commit -m "Description of your choice"` to commit the git to prepare it for upload
8. Use `git remote add origin https://github.com/ros1025/pixiworld.git` to connect the git to the repository.
9. Use `git push origin edit` to push your edits onto the editing git.
10. Wait until the managers approve of the changes made. This may take some time.
